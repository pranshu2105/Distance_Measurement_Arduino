# Distance_Measurement_Arduino
## Introduction
We made a proper running hardware project using the Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor that measures shorter distances precisely. Our objective is based on the concept of ultrasonic waves transmitted by the ultrasonic sensor and received from obstacles.

## Video
We had also created video on explaination of working of the model which we created using Arduino, ultrasonic sensor,and LCD-display. You can check that out using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1458BP7Pz8NURIsmfIVp4wY4-DRW6kjOo/view?usp=sharing).
